            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>We are a small, passionate team of developers who love what we do. We all came together after not being satisfied with what current discord bots offer.</p>
            <p>We are all experienced developers and most of us are certified. We have both experienced Web Developers and experience in a large number of programming languages.</p>
            <p>We have a friendly community on Discord where we are happy to help other devlopers and take suggestions from our community for features they would like to see.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
        <div id="about-what"> <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            <p>We work with many server owners currently finding out what exactly they would like to see in discord bots. We then work on delivering these features in our discord bots.</p>
            <p>We also develop discord bots for people based on their requirements. We will work with them to deliver what they require and they can even make the bot private if they choose.</p>
            <p>We like to help to improve the community we are a part of. We believe that our discord bots can help to do this!</p>

    <section class="about-section">
        <div id="about-why">
            <h2>Why do we do this?</h2>
            <p>We started to do this because we were not satisified by all the great features locked behind paywalls. We formed this group to allow servers to have great features without breaking the bank!</p>
            <p>This is something that we all enjoy doing. If we did not form this group we would have probably, in a reduced capacity, be doing roughly the same thing.</p>
            <p>We love to solve problems. Every new discord bot is a new problem and we love to solve these problems.</p>
