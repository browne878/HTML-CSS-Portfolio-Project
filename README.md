You can see the live website [here](https://browne878.github.io/HTML-CSS-Portfolio-Project/).

The purpose of this website is to advertise Discord bots. It does this by giving explanations to what each bot does and gives some insight to why each bot was developed.

My aim with this website was to use a similar colour scheme to discord to match where the bots will be used. I also wanted to make the website easy to navigate and not overwhelm the user with information. I wanted to keep all the information concise but make more detail easily availible to the user if the require it.
