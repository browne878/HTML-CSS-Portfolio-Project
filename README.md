You can see the live website [here](https://browne878.github.io/HTML-CSS-Portfolio-Project/).

The purpose of this website is to advertise Discord bots. It does this by giving explanations to what each bot does and gives some insight to why each bot was developed.

My aim with this website was to use a similar colour scheme to discord to match where the bots will be used. I also wanted to make the website easy to navigate and not overwhelm the user with information. I wanted to keep all the information concise but make more detail easily availible to the user if the require it.

    ![Screenshot of Support Page](assets/images/images-readme/contact-page.png)

## **Future Development**

- Burger Menu
        - I plan to add a burger menu for navigation on smaller screen sizes at a later date. I believe this will make the header look a lot better on smaller screen sizes and make it easy on touch screens.

- Side Navigation for Bots Page
        - As the number of bots increases I plan to change the bots page to have a navigation element on the left side of the screen. This will allow the user to navigate the list of bots for information easily.
        - I did not impliment this feature now as I do not think that we have enough bots to justify it. It would leave the page feeling empty and the extra navigation would take up more space than needed.

- Live Chat for Support Issues
        - I would like to add this feature directly into the website in the future as I believe it would make reaching out to the team a lot easier for the user. It would prevent us from having to direct the user away from the website for live support.

## **Testing**

### Lighthouse
- I began by using generating a Lighthouse report for each page of the website for mobile and desktop. This allowed me to identify that the background images I was using were too big. To resolve this, I cut them down to 1920x1080 which is a more reasonable size to work.

### HTML Validator
- Once the website was completed, I entered each page into the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). The results from each can be found in the following locations:
    - Home Page ([index.html](assets/images/images-readme/html-checker-index.png))
    - Bots Page ([bots.html](assets/images/images-readme/html-checker-bots.png))
    - About Page ([about.html](assets/images/images-readme/html-checker-about.png))
    - Contact Page ([contact.html](assets/images/images-readme/html-checker-contact.png))

### CSS Validator
- Once I completed the website, I entered the CSS file into [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The results from the CSS file can be found [here](assets/images/images-readme/css-validator.png).
    - There were no errors found in the validation however, there were warnings related to browser specific extensions that can be ignored.

## **Bugs**

### Bots Page
There is 1 known bug on the Bots Page. This bug occurs once you open and close one of the Bot Modals and then increase the screen size to greater than 1100px wide. The modal closed will not appear after adjusting the screen size.

### Local Deployment

These instructions will tell you how to deploy the repository on your local machine with VSCode and the extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Please ensure you have VSCode and the Live Server extension installed before beginning the following steps.

### Remote Deployment

I deployed this website using GitHub Pages. The steps I took to do this are as follows.

1. Start by navigating to the GitHub repository.
2. Next, towards the top of the page, navigate to the `Settings` tab.
3. After this, on the menu of the left of the page, click on the `Pages` tab.
4. Now, click the `Branch` dropdown menu and select `Main` or whatever the name of your main branch is.
5. Finally, wait for the site to be published. This can take a few moments. The link will be shown at the top of the page.
